## Reporting vulnerabilities

You may report vulnerabilities to info@viavario.be

Make sure to include the following information when reporting a vulnerability:

1. A short description of the vulnerability
2. A severity assessment (we suggest to use the [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1))
3. The detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. The expected results
5. The actual result
6. The suggested solution (if applicable)

We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's users, and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.
